# BINGO
A game designed in C++. Do give it a shot! 

Here is a game designed by me in C++ named Bingo which is a 2 player game.
This game is for two people playing. Each person can choose one number in the 5 * 5 box each turn.
Players respectively call out a number between 1-25, which is then struck out by both the players. 
Straight or transverse or oblique five tag number can be a line. The one who reached five lines at first is the winner!

Directions to play:
Key buildings:
W:move up
A:move left
S:move down
D:move right
I: insert a number

Good luck!
